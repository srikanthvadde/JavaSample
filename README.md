1.I enhanced my code to reusable somehow.and updated the code 
2.previously so much clumpsy and so many unneseccary methods may made you confusion because of for first time i didnot spend that much time .now the clean already cleaned.
3.Caterpillar problem i dint understand.i.e.D.2.please exaplain if possible.
4.The bonus section still didnot completed. will complete in weekend soon because i am employee i will get time rare.
5.Hopefully my code will meets your requirements.
6.Instead of created count method in every class i just created in animal and Bird class however the remaining classses must and should extend any one of the above classes(Bird,animal).(Count methoid In animal class is enough because every class extennding the same class directly or indirectly)
7.Here i use some dynamic bining concept which the debugger decides the class and method at run time .
8.Hopefully get positive response from your side.
